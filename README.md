# Weather-app-application-using-django
 I'll create a weather app using Django framework that gets the current weathers for multiple cities. To do this, I'll use Python Requests to call the Open Weather Map API. And it shows you how API works and how to display images with other static files while rendering the HTML template for the main app.
